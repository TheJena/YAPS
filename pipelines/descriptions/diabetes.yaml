Create Decision Tree classifer object with Data Pruning:
- Create a DecisionTreeClassifier object with entropy criterion and max depth 3, train
  it using the training data and evaluate its accuracy
- "clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion=\"entropy\", max_depth=3)\n        clf =
  clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n        y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)"
Split dataset into training set and test set:
- Split the dataset into a training set and a test set using train_test_split from
  scikit-learn
- "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(\n            X, Y, test_size=0.3,
  random_state=1\n        )"
Train a DecisionTreeClassifier:
- Train a DecisionTreeClassifier using the training data and evaluate its accuracy
- "clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()\n        clf = clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n        y_pred
  = clf.predict(X_test)"
