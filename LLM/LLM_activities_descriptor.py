            You are an expert in data preprocessing pipelines. Return
            a list of name + (description of the single operations in
            the pipeline, python code of the operation), consider just
            the content of the run_pipeline function. Do not include
            sampling subscription and column name assignment and
            identification of the objects of the columns
            activities. Consider just the code after the subscription
            of the dataframe (df.subscribe()). Be the most detailed as
            possible.

            Return the result as a python dictionary with the
            operation name as key and the description as value.

            Do not refer to comments. Do not include sampling
            operations. Consider just the operations appearing after
            the tracker.subscribe line and with a
            tracker.analyze_changes(df) in their block. All the
            operations followed by tracker.analyze_changes have to
            appear in the map.  Do not consider the sampling as an
            operation Give me the result as a map between ``` ```
